These schema files are for display purposes ONLY.  DO NOT use these for validation. 
The schema namespace has been altered to reflect the October draft because XML 
SPY cannot read the newest March 2001 draft.  Some attributes have also been dropped.
The documentation has also been removed from these files because XML SPY cannot
handle the annotation tag.
