<H2>User Guide to the Data Manager Library API</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

The purpose of the Data Manager Library is to provide an Application Programming Interface (API)
through which a calling application can access an EML (or other metadata) document, parse its contents, download its related data
entities, store those data entities as tables in a relational database, and query those tables
using SQL-like constructs.


<H3>Installation and Configuration</H3>

<H4>Minimum Requirements</H4>

<OL>

<LI>
One of the following relational database management systems:
</LI>

<UL>
<LI>HSQL</LI>
<LI>Oracle</LI>
<LI>PostgreSQL</LI>

</UL>

<LI>
A recent Java SDK; j2sdk1.4.2 or later is required.
</LI>

</OL>

<H4>Installation</H4>

Download and uncompress file <code>datamanager-1.0.0.zip</code> (Windows) or 
<code>datamanager-1.0.0.tar.gz</code> (Linux or Unix).
The Java application that uses this library (referred to throughout this document as the Calling 
Application) should include the <code>datamanager.jar</code> file in its Java classpath.


<H3>Using the Data Manager Library API</H3>

The Calling Application interacts with the Data Manager Library through its API. The API exposes
to the Calling Application a set of public methods in the following Java class:<br><br>

org.ecoinformatics.datamanager.DataManager<br><br>
  
The capabilities provided to the Calling Application and their related methods in the DataManager
class are summarized in the table below:
<br><br>

<TABLE border=true>

  </TR>

    Query the data from the relational database
    </TD>
    <TD>
    <code>selectData()</code>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

<br><br>

Use cases corresponding to these four capabilities are 
detailed in <a href="../uml/useCases.pdf">useCases.pdf</a>.

<H4>Requirements of the Calling Application</H4>
The Calling Application is required to provide class implementations of the following interfaces:

<UL>

<LI>org.ecoinformatics.datamanager.database.DatabaseConnectionPoolInterface
<br><br>
The Calling Application must implement a class containing methods to get a database connection
from a connection pool, return a database connection to the connection pool, and get the database 
adapter name corresponding to the RDBMS being used by the application. An example of an 
implementing class can be found in the Code Examples section below.
</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>org.ecoinformatics.datamanager.download.EcogridEndPointInterface
<br><br>
The Calling Application must implement a class containing methods to provide a Metacat Ecogrid
end point, provide a SRB Ecogrid end point, and provide a SRB machine name. An example of an implementing
class can be found in the Code Examples section below.
</LI>

</UL>

<em>To Be Completed</em>

<H3>Future Enhancements</H3>

Additional capabilities planned for the Data Manager Library will include:
<br><br>

<TABLE border=true>
  <TR>
    <TH>
    Use Case
    </TH>
    <TH>
    Capability
    </TH>

    DataManager Method Name
    </TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>
    5
    </TD>
    <TD>
Set an upper limit on the size of the database. The Data Manager Library will monitor the size
of the database, and if the upper limit (as set by the Calling Application) is exceeded, old data tables
will be dropped as needed to free up space in the database.
    </TD>
    <TD>
    <code>setDatabaseSize()</code>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>
    6
    </TD>
    <TD>
Set a life-span priority on individual data tables. This relates to the previous capability 
(Use Case 5), in that the Calling Application may single out individual data tables as high priority 
to indicate that they should <em>not</em> be dropped when the database exceeds the specified size 
limit.
    </TD>
    <TD>
    <code>setTableExpirationPolicy()</code>
    </TD>
  </TR>
