            <example>
            The major unanswered question in marine ecology is the degree of
            connectedness between local populations. Put another way, what
            proportion of young arriving into a local population are products 
            of local production? What is the source of recruits for any local population, 
            and where do the young produced in a local population go? The answers 
            to these questions are unknown for any widespread species with a pelagic 
            dispersal phase. Proper marine management depends on knowledge in this 
            area: the efficacy of any reserve design, for example, is highly dependent 
            on the degree to which it is dependent on other populations for 
            recruitment, and the degree to which it supplies other areas.
