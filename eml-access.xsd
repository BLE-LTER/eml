      <moduleDescription>
        The EML Access Module describes the level of access that is to be
        granted or denied to particular users or groups for a given resource
        (e.g a dataset or document).
        The EML Access Module represents a list of resources to be controlled
        in the context of a particular authentication system. That is, the 
        authentication system determines the set of principals (users + groups) 
        that can be used, and the membership of users in groups.  The rules
        set in this module will determine the level of access to a resource for
        the defined users and groups.

                      The Resource type includes all of the elements that a resource
                      element will inherit.  At the moment, in the context of access
                      control, this type contains one element, resourceIdentifier, which
                      is a reference to a resource in a storage system.

              The authentication system determines the set of principals

              and the membership of users in groups. This element is intended 
              to provide a reference to the authentication system in order to 
              verify the user or group.  This reference is typically in the 
              form of a URI, which includes the  connection protocol, internet 
              host, and path to the authentication mechanism.
