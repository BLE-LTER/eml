        <doc:moduleDescription>
          The eml module is a wrapper container that allows inclusion of
          any metadata content in a single EML document.  In general,
          dataset resources, literature resources, collection  resources, and
          software resources, or another type that extends eml-resource
          must lead off the collection in the eml 
          element because these resources contain the "triple" element that
          allows specification of the relationships among the various 
          components of the data package.

        <doc:summary>
          A collection of EML metadata documents linked using the eml-resource
          "triple" element.
        </doc:summary>
        <doc:description>
          The "eml" element allows for the inclusion of arbitrary metadata
          documents as child elements of a single document.  There is
          no validity constraint that restricts what metadata may be
          present, although it is recommended that one (and only one)
          metadata document that derives from eml-resource be included in
          the set so that the "triple" element can be used to determine
          the appropriate relationships among the various documents.
          This is accomplished by explicitly stating the relationships by
          referencing the "identifer" elements that are contained within
          each metadata element.  For example, one could indicate that
          several uniquely identified data objects are a part of the data
          package, and which of the various eml modules describe the entity,
          attribute, and constraints for each of those data objects.
