      <doc:moduleDescription>
        The eml module is a wrapper container that allows inclusion of
        any metadata content in a single EML document.  In general,
        dataset resources, literature resources, collection  resources, and
        software resources, or another type that extends eml-resource
        must lead off the collection in the eml 
        element because these resources contain the "triple" element that
        allows specification of the relationships among the various 
        components of the data package.

          A collection of EML metadata documents linked using the eml-resource "triple" element.

        <doc:description>
          The "eml" element allows for the inclusion of arbitrary metadata documents as
          child elements of a single document.  There is no validity constraint that 
          restricts what metadata may be present, although it is recommended that one (and
          only one) metadata document that derives from eml-resource be included in the set 
          so that the "triple" element can be used to determine the appropriate relationships 
          among the various documents.  This is accomplished by explicitly stating the 
          relationships by referencing the "identifer" elements that are contained within 
          each metadata element.  For example, one could indicate that several uniquely
          identified data objects are a part of the data package, and which of the various
          eml modules describe the entity, attribute, and constraints for each of those data 
          objects.
