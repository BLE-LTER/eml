Data sets are generally classified as fixedWidth format or
variableWidth format, but we have determined that this is actually a
per-field classification because one may encounter fixedWidth fields
mixed together in the same data file with variableWidth fields.

In our encoding scheme, the start of each field is assumed to be the
column after the last column of the previous field, or the first column
if this is the first field in the dataset.  The end column for each
field is classified using either a special character delimeter, or a
fixed field length.  variableWidth fields can vary in their field length, 
and the end of the field is delimited by a special character called a field 
delimiter, usually a comma or a tab character.  fixedWidth fields have a set
length, and so the end of the field can always be determined by adding
the fieldWidth to the starting column number.  Here is an example:

Assume we have the following data in a data set:

May,100aaa,1.2,
April,200aaa,3.4,
June,300bbb,4.6,

The metadata for the 4 fields would include the following:
<attribute><name>month</name><delimiter>,</delimiter></attribute>

<attribute><name>sitecode</name><fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth></attribute>

<attribute><name>subsitecode</name><fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth></attribute>

<attribute><name>response</name><delimiter>,</delimiter></attribute>
