                The eml-semantics module - Semantic annotations for formalizing meaning
          </title>
          <para>
                The eml-semantics module defines types and elements for annotating other
                structures within EML with semantically-precise terms from various
                controlled vocabularies.  This is accomplished by associating the global
                URI for a term along with the common label for the term with one of the
                elements within EML, such as an attribute, an entity, or an overall dataset.
                It is used throughout the other EML modules where detailed semantic 
                information is needed.

            <para>The SemanticAnnotation Type contains 
                elements that are used to associate a controlled term from a specific
                formal vocabulary with other elements within EML.  For example, one
                might want to provide the precise set of terms from an ontology that
                clarify the measurement semantics of an attribute within a data set, 
                or associate a specific term with a data table or dataset.

              <doc:summary>The persistent URI used to identify a term from a vocabulary.
              </doc:summary>
              <doc:description>The URI for a term that is drawn from a controlled
                  vocabulary such as a published ontology or controlled term list. These terms
                  should provide a semantically-precise definition of the term, inlcuding various
                  relationships to related terms.  Term URIs are typically drawn from formal
                  ontologies that provide well-defined logical semantics and provide for various
                  types of reasoning about term equivalence and overlap.
                  Term URIs should be persistent and unique over decades,
                  and the meaning of the terms associated with the URI should be stable
                  over time as well. These URIs are usually constructed using
                  an additional abstraction layer via link resolvers, rather than directly
                  resolving to the term definition itself.  Thus, when resolving the termURI, 
                  software user agents should be prepared to follow multiple redirects before
                  finally resolving the current location of the term definition.

              <doc:description>
                  A label that provides a human readable representation of
                  the controlled term. The label is often used to represent the controlled
                  term when displaying annotations in software. The label is often redundant
                  with one or more labels that are defined in the controlled vocabulary itself,
                  but is repreated here within the EML document to make it easy for consumers to
                  display the annotation to users.  Other labels, including labels in multiple
                  languages, may often be accessible from within the ontology or controlled
                  vocabularly accessible at the termURI.  Term definitions and relationships to 
                  other terms are also typically provided within the vocabularly accessible 
                  at the termURI.  Software and people can resolve the term URI to find out 
                  the definition of the term and retrieve additional labels and other metadata
                  about the term for presentation to users.
