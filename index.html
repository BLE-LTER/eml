   <p>
    Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a metadata standard developed
    by the ecology discipline and for the ecology discipline.  It is based
    on prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated
    efforts (Michener et al., 1997, Ecological Applications).
    EML is implemented as a series of XML document types that can
    by used in a modular and extensible manner to document ecological data.
    Each EML module is designed to describe one logical part of the total
    metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are currently in the process of revising EML to create the
    version 2.0 standard described below.  This is an ongoing process,
    and the current draft is being released for public comment and
    input on the revisions. The current draft is the result of a
    two workshops in which a variety of information managers
    gathered to review and revise EML. This draft represents the concensus
    view of an ecological metadata specification from those meetings.  We
    expect that the current draft will be quite stable in terms of the
    structure of conforming instance documents, although minor changes
    may still be made before the final version 2 release is cut.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i><b>Warning: this version is currently
    being developed and therefore it will change as its form is
    finalized.  We'll release a final version here when it is available.
    </b></i>
    Please continue to use version 1.4.1 in production
    environments until we have finalized the version 2.0.0 release.  Thanks.

    Developers may be interested in browsing the
    <a href="http://cvs.ecoinformatics.org/cvs/cvsweb.cgi/eml/">source code 
    CVS repository</a> that we use in developing EML. This always contains 
    the most recent development version of EML, and therefore may be in
    flux, or otherwise broken.  It is unlikely that it will contain the same
    files that are in the current release (@version@).
    Use at your own risk.  Write access to this repository is reserved
    for EML project members. We welcome contributions to this work in any
    form.  Individuals who invest substantial amounts of time and make
    valuable contributions to the development and maintenace of EML
    (in the opinion of current project members) will 
    be invited to become EML project members according to the rules set forth
    in the 
    <a href="http://www.ecoinformatics.org/charter.html">ecoinformatics.org 
    Charter</a>. Contributions can take many forms, including the development
    of the EML schemas, writing documentation, and helping with maintenance,
    among others.
