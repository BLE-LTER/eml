  </para>
  <para> Several modifications to the EML schema made in version 2.1.0 will require changes to how 
  EML documents are structured, and these changes are highlighted here. EML authors should also 
  refer to the affected sections in the normative schema documents for complete usage 
  information and examples. Existing EML 2.0-series documents can be converted to EML 2.1.0 
  using the XSL stylesheet that accompanies this release, as described in section 2 below. </para>
  <para> The EML 2.1.0 release addresses several errors with respect to W3C specifications 
  for XML schema (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml). Although the changes are small, 
  they are incompatible with EML 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 schemas, which necessitated advancing the 
  version number to "2.1". The STMML schema was also found to be invalid with respect to XML 
  Schema language, and the most reasonable fix for this bug also is incompatible with its earlier 
  versions. EML users should note that the STMML schema error was <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
  related to elements used directly by EML (i.e., &lt;unitList&gt; or &lt;unitType&gt;). However, 
  EML imports all of STMML, and 
  authors of EML documents may have made use of other parts of that schema. Therefore, 
  it was decided to advance the namespace used for STMML-related imports to "stmml-1.1", 
  in keeping with the EML version naming pattern. The STMML authors have been contacted, 
  and they are interested in our development and use of STMML. </para>
  <para> Other features and enhancements were added to this release that represent significant 
  improvements. The XML data type requirements for several elements were changed, in some 
  cases to constrain their content, and in other cases to increase flexibility. The names of two 
  elements were changed make them consistent throughout EML. In the literature schema two 
  elements became optional so that EML could accommodate in-press publications where 
  the volume and page range are not yet known. Support for two new optional elements was 
  also added: a 'contact' tree can now be used in the literature module, and a ‘descriptive’ element 
  can be used in distribution trees.</para>
  <para> For the most part, EML 2.1.0 does not introduce major new features, or require a 
  shift in use or implementation. There was a deliberate decision to balance the impact on 
  instance document authors with necessary schema maintenance, and to prepare the schema 
  for the next phase of planned improvements and features. Some of the changes to EML 2.1.0 
  are invisible to document authors; see the 'Readme' that accompanies the distribution for a 
  complete list of the bugs addressed, and for information of interest to developers.</para>

          <para>EML Schema validity</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>EML allows authors to place any XML markup in
            &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; sections at the end of the document. The content
            model for &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; includes an optional &lt;describes&gt; 
            element so that references to EML nodes can be included as necessary.
            In EML 2.0 this element was placed alongside the additional XML content; 
            however, this construct is not allowed in XML Schema, and the error was 
            not reported by XML parsers available at the time EML 2.0 was released. 
            In EML 2.1.0, the error has been corrected by adding a required child element
            to the &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; section to contain the
            "&lt;xs:any&gt;" XML content. </para>
            
          <para>&lt;additionalMetadata&gt; sections must include the child
            &lt;metadata&gt; to contain the additional XML markup. The optional
            &lt;describes&gt; element may still be included to reference a particular node
            of the document. Multiple &lt;describes&gt; elements can be included if needed. 
            Examples of documents written against 2.1.0 and 2.0.1 are below. Also see the
            <ulink url="eml.html#additionalMetadata">additionalMetadata normative documentation</ulink>.
            </para>
          <para> In EML 2.0.1, an additionalMetadata section looked like this: <programlisting><![CDATA[...
 <additionalMetadata>
 <describes>123</describes>
  <unitList>
   <unit name="speciesPerSquareMeter" 
         unitType="arealDensity"

	 parentSI="numberPerSquareMeter" 
	 multiplierToSI="1"/>
  </unitList>
 </additionalMetadata>...]]></programlisting>
          </para>
          <para> In EML 2.1.0, the markup must be enclosed within &lt;metadata&gt; tags: <programlisting><![CDATA[

        <question>
          <para>STMML Schema validity</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>EML makes use of the Scientific Technical and Medical Markup Language schema
            (STMML, stmml.xsd) for describing units, and the STMML schema was also found to 
            be invalid. The error was not related to
            elements used directly by EML (i.e., &lt;unitList&gt; or
            &lt;unitType&gt;), however some authors may have used other parts of stmml.xsd
            in their documents. The required schema changes were not compatible with STMML-1.0, and
            the EML development group is working with the STMML developers on this
            issue. Since EML now imports a version of STMML that is not identical to that available
            from its authors, it was decided to advance the namespace used by EML 2.1.0 for stmml-related 
            files to "stmml-1.1". To import stmml.xsd into one of your EML 2.1.0 documents use the XML 
            namespace            declaration for STMML in the code below: <programlisting><![CDATA[

        <question>
          <para>Location of Access Control Trees</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In EML 2.0.1 an &lt;access&gt; tree could be included in each top-level module (i.e. dataset, 
          citation, software, or protocol) to control access to the entire metadata document. Additionally, to 
          control access to individual entities, 
          some authors put &lt;access&gt; trees in &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; sections and used
          &lt;describes&gt; elements to reference their &lt;distribution&gt; nodes. 
          Authors may have inferred that access 
          control could  be applied to any node with this practice. However, node-level access 
          control is problematic to implement, and in practice only access trees that reference 
          distribution nodes are recognized (as was stated in EML 2.0.1 documentation). 
          A better solution is to locate &lt;access&gt; nodes above or near the node to 
          which the access rules should be applied. This feature has been added to 
          EML 2.1.0. </para>
            
          <para> In EML 2.1.0, access trees can be placed in 2 locations. To control the entire
            metadata document (i.e., "document-level access"), an &lt;access&gt; tree should
            be placed as a child of the root element (<ulink url="eml.png">EML image</ulink>). If a
            metadata author wishes to override the document-level control for a specific entity, an
            additional access tree may be placed as the last child of a &lt;distribution&gt;
            element within the &lt;physical&gt; tree of that entity 
            (<ulink url="eml-physicalDistribution.png">Physical Distribution Type image</ulink>).
            The structure of the access module itself has not changed (<ulink url="eml-access.html">access 
            module documentation</ulink> ).</para>
          <para>Example 1. To control access to all the metadata and by default to the data, use an
            &lt;access&gt; element at the top level: <programlisting><![CDATA[
<eml:eml>
 <access>
  ...
 </access>
 <dataset>
   ...
 </dataset>
 <additionalMetadata>
   ...
 </additionalMetadata>
</eml:eml>  
      	]]></programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>Example 2. Access rules can still be specified for any data entity by placing an
            access tree under that entity's physical/distribution element. The following example
            illustrates how a dataTable's access tree  can be used to override permissions 
            set at the document level.
            If no access is specified in distribution then the document-level access rules are
            applied. </para>

        <answer>
          <para>The content of the  &lt;gRing&gt; element was retyped to make these nodes more usable. This
            element is generally analogous to the FGDC component for ring. This element should now contain 
            a string       comprised of a comma-delimited sequence of longitude and latitude values for vertex
            coordinates (in decimal degrees), as in the example below. For more information, see the normative documents 
            for gRing in the <ulink url="eml-coverage.html#gRing">

        <question>
          <para>Entity Attributes: &lt;bounds&gt; minimum and maximum are of type
          xs:float</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In EML 2.0.1, &lt;bounds&gt; elements  were typed as 
          xs:decimal and did not support scientific notation. The base data type 
          was changed to 'xs:float' in EML 2.1.0 to accommodate both decimal and scientific 
          notation while maintaining backward compatibility. Authors should keep 
          in mind that there are still advantages to using decimal numbers for bounds, 
          because the decimal data type maintains precision during storage while 
          the floating point type does not. An alternative type, "precisionDecimal" 
          (corresponding to the IEEE type "floating-point decimal”), may be available 
          in the next version of XML Schema (i.e.,  v1.1, a working draft as of late 2008).
           It combines features of both the decimal and float types in that it supports 
           the values and notation of a float, but is treated as decimal in arithmetic 
           and storage. The typing of this element may be changed to this new 
           type in a future release of EML.  For more information, see the normative
           documentation for <ulink url="eml-attribute.html#NumericDomainType">
           NumericDomainType</ulink>.</para>
           
          <para>In EML 2.1.0, bounds can be written as: <programlisting><![CDATA[

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In EML 2.0.0 and 2.0.1, altitude units were typed as xs:string, 
          and EML authors were instructed to include a vertical datum along 
          with the unit. In EML 2.1.0 this has been revised. Altitudes are now 
          restricted to lengths in Standard Units (e.g. meter, foot, etc), and the 
          datum should be included as part of the textual geographicDescription element. Document 
          authors should note that including any additional content in the  
          &lt;altitudeUnits&gt; element other than a length value, such as the datum, 
          is not valid in EML 2.1.0. For a list of allowable units, see <ulink url="eml-coverage.html#altitudeUnits">

        <answer>
          <para>In EML 2.0.1, latitude and longitude values in &lt;geographicCoverage&gt;
           elements were typed as a xs:string. In EML 2.1.0 these values are restricted to 
           decimal numbers with realistic ranges (-90 to 90, and -180 to 180, respectively). 
           Fractions of a degree in minutes and seconds should be converted to decimal 
           format, and strings denoting direction or hemisphere (e.g., 'S' or 'south') are not 
           allowed. South latitudes and west longitudes must be indicated by a minus 
           sign (-) in front of the coordinate, as in the example below. These constraints 
           are consistent with the intended use of this field, which is to support mapping 
           the general geographic coverage of EML resources. Authors should keep in 
           mind that very specific descriptions of spatial data can be accommodated by 
           EML modules dedicated to that purpose. More information on bounding coordinates can

        <answer>
          <para>In EML 2.0.1, elements of the string data type were allowed to be 
          empty or contain only whitespace. This feature 
          was occasionally exploited as a work-around to force incomplete documents 
          to validate in XML editors and the Metacat harvester, but this practice may
           cause problems in document parsing or for EML tools such as Kepler. 
          In EML 2.1.0, string content is now typed as "NonEmptyString" and string 
          entities are required to have minimal non-whitespace content. So, whereas the following 
          content would have been allowed in EML 2.0.1: <programlisting><![CDATA[

        <question>
          <para>About the EML conversion stylesheet</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>An XSL stylesheet, 'eml201to210.xsl' is provided with the EML 2.1.0
          distribution to convert valid EML 2.0-series documents to EML 2.1.0.
          The intent of this reference to not to provide comprehensive
            instructions for transforming XML documents since adequate information is available
            elsewhere. A few specific examples will be given here, along with recommended 
            practices and discussion of issues            likely to occur when transforming EML 2.0 to 2.1.  
            The reader is referred to XSLT references available at W3C schools 
            (http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/), Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/), W3C 
            (http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/) and various books for more information about

         <para>You will first need to identify or obtain a program (or programming language module) 
         capable of transforming XML using an XSL stylesheet. Suitable programs are available for 
         all computer platforms, and modules are included in or are available for most programming 
         and scripting languages. For example, Linux distributions generally include a command line utility 
         called "xsltproc".</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>Here are examples illustrating how to transform an EML document from the
                 command line using xsltproc. In the first example, the redirect operator is used to save
                 the output to a file.     An explicit output argument can also be used instead of a redirect.
       
                  <programlisting>
 xsltproc eml201to210.xsl eml201_doc.xml > eml210_doc.xml                  </programlisting>

 xsltproc -output eml210_doc.xml path/to/stylesheet/eml201to210.xsl eml201_doc.xml              </programlisting>
                To include a new value for the packageId attribute, the stylesheet will accept a parameter 
                 called 'package-id' from the calling program:
                  <programlisting>
 xsltproc -stringparam package-id knb-lter-sbc.1006.4 eml201to210.xsl eml201_doc.xml > eml210_doc.xml                   </programlisting>

          <para>Validity of new EML 2.1.0 documents</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
                <para>
           Because of the flexibility allowed in EML, the stylesheet may encounter EML 2.0.1 structures that 
           cannot be transformed as stated above or that may result in invalid EML 2.1.0 after processing. 
           The stylesheet is able to detect some of these conditions (below). In these cases, the stylesheet 
           creates the new EML 2.1.0 document, but also issues an alert about the potential problem. This 
           may mean that the EML 2.0.1 document must be a) examined manually, edited and reprocessed, 
           b) transformed by your own custom method, or c) the stylesheet's output used as a template to 
           create valid EML 2.1.0.
          <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>An &lt;access&gt; tree is present in &lt;additionalMetadata&gt;, but an adjacent &lt;describes&gt; 
                element did not reference a &lt;distribution&gt; node. The &lt;access&gt; tree will be left in 
                &lt;additionalMetadata&gt;, the rest of the document transformed, and a message printed to 
                notify the user. 
                </para>
              </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Two (or more) &lt;access&gt; trees are present in &lt;additionalMetadata&gt;, and 
                reference the same &lt;distribution&gt; element via their sibling &lt;describes&gt; tags. 
                If the "orderBy" attributes on all &lt;access&gt; elements match, then the &lt;access&gt; 
                trees will be merged (with rules listed in document order) and moved to the appropriate 
                &lt;distribution&gt; element. If the "orderBy" attributes are not identical, the stylesheet 
                will not attempt to resolve the issue.  The &lt;access&gt; trees will all remain in &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; 
                (while the rest of the document transformed) and a message will be printed to notify the user.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>Empty content appears in an element which is typed as "NonEmptyString" in EML2.1.0.
                 The document is transformed but the user warned that it will not be valid EML 2.1.0 due to the 
                 missing content. </para>
              </listitem>
 
            </orderedlist>
          </para>
          <para>In addition to those noted above, there are possible EML constructs which the stylesheet
          cannot detect, but which might result in invalid EML 2.1.0. For example, by design &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; 
          sections are            parsed laxly, and so it is possible for their content in EML-2.0.0/1 to
            contain &lt;access&gt; trees that are not valid EML.
            Also, the content of several elements has been more tightly
            constrained in EML 2.1.0 (e.g., latitude and longitude), but only empty content is 
            reasonably detected by the transformation stylesheet.</para>
            <para>
            For these reasons, document authors are advised to check the validity of their new EML 2.1 using the
            EML parser after transformation. EML instance documents can be validated in two ways: <orderedlist>

                  directory of the EML release and run the 'runEMLParser' script passing your EML
                  instance file as a parameter. The script performs two actions: it validates the document against the
                  EML 2.1 schema, and it checks the validity of references and id attributes (as of EML 2.1.0).</para>
