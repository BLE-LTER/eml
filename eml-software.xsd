          the 'software' element contains general information about a
          software resource that is being documented.  This is field is
          intended to give information for software tools that are needed 
          to interpret a dataset, software that was written to process a
          resource, or software as a resource in itself.
          It includes the version, the programming language,
          and the location of the software, along with the source code
          information or binary file information.  The information 
          provided in the subelements are specific to software 
          resources and extend the Resource type.
