# EML Project Maintainers

[Back to EML Contents](index.html)

The EML project is an open source, community oriented project
dedicated to providing a high-quality metadata specification
for describing data relevant to the ecological discipline.
The project is completely comprised of voluntary project
members who donate their time and experience in order to advance
information management for ecology. Project decisions are made by
concensus according to the voting procedures described in the 
[ecoinformatics.org Charter](http://www.ecoinformatics.org/charter.html).

We welcome contributions to this work in any form.  Individuals
who invest substantial amounts of time and make valuable
contributions to the development and maintenance of EML (in the
opinion of current project members) will be invited to become
EML project members according to the rules set forth in the <a
href="http://www.ecoinformatics.org/charter.html">ecoinformatics.org
Charter</a>. Contributions can take many forms, including the
development of the EML schemas, writing documentation, and helping
with maintenance, among others.

Write access to the EML source code repository is reserved for
EML project members. Contributions should be submitted as pull
requests, and will be reviewed and merged by an EML project member.
