The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecoloigical Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Appications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

The files in this directory include both a Document Type Definition and 
an XML Schema document for each of the following modules, as well as 
complete documentation in the "docs" directory:

Access control               eml-access.[xsd,dtd]
Attribute (variable) info    eml-attribute.[xsd,dtd]
Integrity constraints        eml-constraint.[xsd,dtd]
Geographic, temporal and     eml-coverage.[xsd,dtd]
  taxonomic coverage
Data set info                eml-dataset.[xsd,dtd]
Distribution info            eml-distribution.[xsd,dtd]
Data entity (table) info     eml-entity.[xsd,dtd]
Citation info                eml-literature.[xsd,dtd]
People and organizations     eml-party.[xsd,dtd]
Physical format info         eml-physical.[xsd,dtd]
Research project info        eml-project.[xsd,dtd]
Methods and QA/QC            eml-protocol.[xsd,dtd]
Basic resource info          eml-resource.[xsd,dtd]
Software info                eml-software.[xsd,dtd]

Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description of each of
the modules.

The above files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.  
This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_BETA_3".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the
appropriate release tag (i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).
