The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define a
standard markup syntax.  The files in this directory include both a Document
Type Definition and an XML Schema document for each named module:

eml-resource.[dtd,xsd] (w/ dataset, bibliography, software and collection sections.)
iso-party.[dtd,xsd]
eml-entity.[dtd,xsd]
eml-attribute.[dtd,xsd]
eml-relations.[dtd,xsd]
eml-distribution.[dtd,xsd]
eml-research.[dtd,xsd]
eml-qaqc.[dtd,xsd]
eml-access.[dtd,xsd]
eml-package.[dtd,xsd]
eml-lineage.[dtd,xsd]

There are also a few other files in the directory that are used as utilities to
process the eml module files:

eml-documentation.xsl (a transformation stylesheet for use with an XSLT engine
                       that converts documentation that is embedded in the
		       schema documents into formatted html pages.)
default.css (the cascading stylesheet that defines the layout for the generated
             html pages.)
build.xml (an XML configuration file used with the Ant build system to
           automatically  call the XSLT processor and apply the above stylesheets
	   for the documentation.  A 'docs' directory is created with the 
	   resultant html pages.)

The above files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.  Previous
versions of EML (such as 1.4) are available from this repository using the
appropriate release tag (i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).
