The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecological Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Applications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description 
of each of the modules, and for a link to the full EML specification.

HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS RELEASE
--------------------------
1) Modified eml-attribute measurementScale model to allow precision, unit,
   and attributeDomain to only be used where appropriate
2) Expanded attributeDomain to allow description of all numeric domains
3) Massive documentation improvements.  Thanks to everyone who helped write 
   some of the documentation.
4) New EML Validity Parser created.  It checks both EML rules and the schema
   rules to be sure an XML document is a valid EML document.  It is included 
   with the release, and provided as an online service. See docs/index.html.
5) Much easier to use system for spatial reference that is derived from ESRI's
   .prj format for named projections. Over 2000 predefined projections
   shipped with this EML release.
   
FILES
-----
The files in this directory include a XML Schema document for 
each of the modules that make up EML.  Also included is a schema 
for supporting documentation, and an instance document defining 
standard attribute units for EML.

The files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.0.
This is the third release candidate.  We expect no changes
to EML between now and the final EML 2.0.0 release; this release is
being made available for a 1 week public review as a final sanity
check before EML 2.0.0 is officially released. Note that there have 
been 9 beta releases and two prior release candidates prior
to this during which substantial/philosophical changes were introduced.
This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_0_0_RC_3".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the appropriate release tag 
(i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).

KNOWN ISSUES (see also http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Complete work on the XSLT stylesheets.  Need to convert stylesheets
   to the new structure (they currently work with the BETA6 release)
   (bug 249).
