The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecological Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Appications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description 
of each of the modules.

FILES
-----
The files in this directory include both a Document Type Definition and 
an XML Schema document for each of the following modules, as well as 
complete documentation in the "docs" directory:

Access control               eml-access.[xsd,dtd]
Attribute (variable) info    eml-attribute.[xsd,dtd]
Integrity constraints        eml-constraint.[xsd,dtd]
Geographic, temporal and     eml-coverage.[xsd,dtd]
  taxonomic coverage
Data set info                eml-dataset.[xsd,dtd]
Data entity (table) info     eml-entity.[xsd,dtd]
Citation info                eml-literature.[xsd,dtd]
People and organizations     eml-party.[xsd,dtd]
Physical format info         eml-physical.[xsd,dtd]
Research project info        eml-project.[xsd,dtd]
Methods and QA/QC            eml-protocol.[xsd,dtd]
Basic resource info          eml-resource.[xsd,dtd]
Software info                eml-software.[xsd,dtd]

Also included is a schema for supporting documentation:
Schema documentation info    eml-documentation.xsd

The above files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.  
A number of issues still need to be worked out before the final
version 2 release, but this version has now stabiized and we expect
only minor modifications between this version and the final version 2
release.  This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_BETA_7".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the appropriate release tag 
(i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).

KNOWN ISSUES (see also http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Need to add support for semantic metadata (bug 277)
2) Need formal definitions for responsible party roles (bug 336)
3) Need to find a way to store nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio
   attributes in a meaningful way (bug 337)
4) Complete work on the XSLT stylesheets.  Most are done but there
   are still a few missing.  Also need to figure out how to import
   stylesheets so that templates are not rewritten for each 
   module (bug 249)
5) need lineage and versioning standard (bug 144)

ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------
1) Added a 'style' subdirectory with a style sheet for most modules
   to translate the metadata to HTML
2) Changed names of coverage elements to be human readable
3) Updated the namespaces to reflect the current version number of EML
4) Added an eml-data module for the in-lining of data.
5) Added the eml module for creating packages all in one file.  It is a single
   node with a model of ANY so any of the eml modules can be put into it.
6) Numerous bug fixes (see bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org)
