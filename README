The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecological Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Applications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its content implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the specification and from feedback from the ecological 
community.

This release represents the consensus view of a large number of knowledgeable
scientists and data managers on what metadata are relevant to ecological
data and how best to represent it.  Of course, many might differ in opinion 
about specific decisions made during the development of EML; we would like to
encourage users to faithfully use the specification in the spirit of 
community building.  It is better if we all use a metadata language that covers
most of our needs than to modify it and use one that is perfect but not shared
with anybody.

It is notable that some of the rules regarding EML that are important are
expressed only in the EML specification, not in the XML Schema files.  This is
because XML Schema was not able to express some of the constraints that we
felt were important to creating a coherent metadata document, particularly
with respect to identifiers and references to identifiers.  Thus, we have
included a new EML Validity Parser.  It checks both EML rules and the schema
rules to be sure an XML document is a valid EML document.  It is included
with the release, and provided as an online service. See docs/index.html.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please see the docs/index.html directory for a a list of the relevant
documents pertaining to EML.  In particular, this release ships with a full
version of the EML Specification, which is the definitive document explaining
the rules associated with the Ecological Metadata Language.

FILES
-----
The files in this distribution are a part of the final release of EML 2.0.1.

The files in this directory include a "docs" directory that contains the
EML Specification and all documentation for the modules, and an XML Schema
document for each of the modules that make up EML.  Also included is a schema
for supporting documentation, and an instance document defining standard
attribute units for EML. The "lib/sample/eml-sample.xml" file is a sample
document illustrating the use of EML. The "test" directory contains a number
of sample instance documents used for testing the schemas, and an application
for checking document validity under JUnit (see http://junit.org).

This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_0_1".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the appropriate release tag 
(i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).

HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS RELEASE
--------------------------
This is a bug fix and documentation release.  No changes were made that are
incompatible with the earlier 2.0.0 release.  A new set of XSLT stylesheets
has been included to show how EML can be transformed into an HTML display. 
Significant changes were made to the definition of access control elements
to substantially simplify the access control model and make it easier for
systems storing EML to implement.  In addition, the precision field has 
now been made optional to accomodate data sets that have varying precision
across the records in a single attribute.  Finally, we fixed a bug in the 
"inline" element that had prevented it from being used as intended as a
place to store data inline in an EML document. The reminaing issues are 
largely changes in documentation.

KNOWN ISSUES (see also http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Some problems with unit dictionary remain and will be solved in 
a backwards-incompatible release in the future.  See bug 1000 and 1605.
