The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecological Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Appications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description 
of each of the modules.

FILES
-----
The files in this directory include both a Document Type Definition and 
an XML Schema document for each of the following modules, as well as 
complete documentation in the "docs" directory:

Access control               eml-access.[xsd,dtd]
Attribute (variable) info    eml-attribute.[xsd,dtd]
Integrity constraints        eml-constraint.[xsd,dtd]
Geographic, temporal and     eml-coverage.[xsd,dtd]
  taxonomic coverage
Data set info                eml-dataset.[xsd,dtd]
Data entity (table) info     eml-entity.[xsd,dtd]
Citation info                eml-literature.[xsd,dtd]
People and organizations     eml-party.[xsd,dtd]
Physical format info         eml-physical.[xsd,dtd]
Research project info        eml-project.[xsd,dtd]
Methods and QA/QC            eml-protocol.[xsd,dtd]
Basic resource info          eml-resource.[xsd,dtd]
Software info                eml-software.[xsd,dtd]

Also included is a schema for supporting documentation:
Schema documentation info    eml-documentation.xsd

The above files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.  
A number of issues still need to be worked out before the final
version 2 release, but this version has now stabiized and we expect
only minor modifications between this version and the final version 2
release.  This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_BETA_6".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the appropriate release tag 
(i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).

KNOWN ISSUES (see also http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Multiline records supported sufficiently in eml-physical?
2) Check if eml-coverage uses eml-literature rather than citeinfo?
3) Check if eml-coverage uses ResponsibleParty rather than cntinfo?
4) Should eml-project extend ResourceBase? several fields overlap...
5) The "identifier" element may need to be decomposed into finer grains
6) Need to resolve complete semantics of "triple" elements in eml-resource
