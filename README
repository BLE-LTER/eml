The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecological Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Applications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description 
of each of the modules.

FILES
-----
The files in this directory include a XML Schema document for 
each of the modules that make up EML.  Also included is a schema 
for supporting documentation, and an instance document defining 
standard attribute units for EML.

The files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.0.
This is the first release candidate.  We expect no changes
to these files for the final EML 2.0.0 release.  This release is 
being made available for final testing and feedback before the final
release is made.  Note that there have been 9 beta releases prior
to this during which substantial/philosophical changes were introduced.
This release of EML can be retrieved from CVS using the 
tag "RELEASE_EML_2_0_0_RC_1".  Previous versions of EML (such as 1.4) 
are available from this repository using the appropriate release tag 
(i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).

KNOWN ISSUES (see also http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Complete work on the XSLT stylesheets.  Need to convert stylesheets
   to the new structure (they currently work with the BETA6 release
   (bug 249).

ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------
Beta9 Fixes-
1) Changed packaging concept to use internal id and references instead
   of triples
2) Review and revised all modules according to agrred upon changes from 
   the April, 2002 EML meeting at Sevilleta Field Station

Beta 8 Fixes-
1) Fixed illegal declaration of type and extension in eml-entity
2) Updated all PNG image files

Beta 7 Fixes-
1) Added a 'style' subdirectory with a style sheet for most modules
   to translate the metadata to HTML
2) Changed names of coverage elements to be human readable
3) Updated the namespaces to reflect the current version number of EML
4) Added an eml-data module for the in-lining of data.
5) Added the eml module for creating packages all in one file.  It is a single
   node with a model of ANY so any of the eml modules can be put into it.
6) Numerous bug fixes (see bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org)
