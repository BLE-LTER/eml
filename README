The Ecological Metadata Language consists of a number of modules that define
an XML markup syntax for ecologically relevant metadata.  It was originally
based on work done by the ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term
Ecoloigical Data (http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper
on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 
1997. Ecological Appications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological 
sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.4 follows that paper closely in
its implementation, but Version 2 has been modified substantially after
experience using the standard and from feedback from the ecological community.

The files in this directory include both a Document Type Definition and 
an XML Schema document for each of the following modules, as well as a
graphical summary of the structure (PNG format):

Access control               eml-access.[xsd,dtd,png]
Attribute (variable) info    eml-attribute.[xsd,dtd,png]
Integrity constraints        eml-constraint.[xsd,dtd,png]
Geographic, temporal and     eml-coverage.[xsd,dtd,png]
  taxonomic coverage
Data set info                eml-dataset.[xsd,dtd,png]
Distribution info            eml-distribution.[xsd,dtd,png]
Data entity (table) info     eml-entity.[xsd,dtd,png]
Citation info                eml-literature.[xsd,dtd,png]
People and organizations     eml-party.[xsd,dtd,png]
Physical format info         eml-physical.[xsd,dtd,png]
Research project info        eml-project.[xsd,dtd,png]
Methods and QA/QC            eml-protocol.[xsd,dtd,png]
Basic resource info          eml-resource.[xsd,dtd,png]
Software info                eml-software.[xsd,dtd,png]

Please see the docs/index.html directory for a detailed description of each of
the modules.

There are also a few other files in the directory that are used as utilities
to process the eml module files:

eml-documentation.xsl (a transformation stylesheet for use with an XSLT engine
		       that converts documentation that is embedded in the
		       schema documents into formatted html pages.)
default.css (the cascading stylesheet that defines the layout for the generated
             html pages.)
build.xml (an XML configuration file used with the Ant build system to
           automatically call the XSLT processor and apply the above stylesheets
	   for the documentation.  A 'docs' directory is created with the 
	   resultant html pages.)

The above files are a part of the proposed release of EML 2.0.  Previous
versions of EML (such as 1.4) are available from this repository using the
appropriate release tag (i.e. RELEASE_EML_1_4).
